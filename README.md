Some experiments to produce a chart of visible deep space objects, to help with planning for public nights at Powell Observatory, Louisburg KS.

The objects selected are bright enough to be quickly imaged with SharpCap livestacking, and they are not too large for the FOV of the Ruisinger telescope.

The program uses astropy and astroplanner to do all the hard math.
The database of DSOs was derived (and extended) from data extracted from Stellarium.

To be a candidate for imaging, we use constraints to select:
1. images that will be above 25 degrees altitude
2. and will be at or above that altitude between 8:30PM and 11:30PM local time, since that's when the public nights occur.

There is no formal license attached, but this code is free for anyone to use however they see fit
